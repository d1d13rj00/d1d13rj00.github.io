We always have a need to create documents, whether to create simple memos, checklists, todos or even writing tutorials, product documentation or academic papers.

Nowadays, we have multiple softwares like wordprocessors, typsetters like latex allowing us to do those tasks but my favorite is by using markdown.

## What is markdown

Markdown is a simple and efficient way to write documents using simple and quick syntax. The structure of a document created with markdown is created on using text. It's not a new thing as Latex allows to do the same. However the main advantage of using markdown is it's simple and quick syntax. For more precise and complex documents, latex could be the best choice and already have mautre packages covering graphics and a lot of types of content.

For example to create an article with a title (h1), subtitle(h2) and text, the following syntax could be used: 
```
# This is my title

## This is my subtitle

This is my content
```

More details about common markdown syntax can be found on [Daring Fireball website](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [Markdown tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Useful markdown and markdown-likes

Many kinds of markdowns exists, giving possibilties to create textual and graphical content.

Some of the most commons are 
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/)
- [mermaid](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/) - For flowcharts, gantt, sequence diagram and more
- [plantUML](http://plantuml.com/) - UML and non MUL diagrams such as gantt and sequence diagrams.
- [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) - Most focused on graphs

## If markdown is text, how to render them ? 

As markdown is simply just text defining structure and content. We still need a way to render those documents.

For that we have a lot of tools that allows editing, exporting and sometimes live previews of the documents.
